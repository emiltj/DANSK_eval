# Use stuff from "inter_annotators_vs_DANSK_matrix copy.ipynb"
# Load everything in data/interrater_final_data/*

# DANSK KAPPA
# Merge single-gold-accept with 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 into "raters"
# Calculate kappa between "raters" and "dansk.jsonl"

# RATERS KAPPA
# Calculate kappa between 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

# Merge the two resulting kappa pd's
